# A simple movie recommendation system

This report presents the results of creating a movie recommendation system using the 10M version of Movie-
Lens dataset available at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/

The report uses a machine learning algorithm following a model based approach and the calculation of the
residual mean squared error (RMSE) to compare models.

This report is structured in three sections. The next section explains the methods and analysis used including
data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, and the modelling approach. The results section presents
the modelling results and discusses the model performance using the RMSE as a loss function. The final
section gives a brief summary of the report, its limitations and future work.
